# React Opinions

Opinions are necessary. Without opinions, the team spends time debating small trivial matters. This would be fine, if we lived in a realm of engineering purity. But we don't. We live in the real world, and we are paid to solve real problems for real people. Time spent debating trivial matters is time not spent delivering features.

Okay, fine, but why not use an existing framework? That's what they're for, right? Angular, Loopback, Jumpsuit, MobX. They're all meant to abstract away the little details so that developers can focus on features. Yes, and that's great. But I personally like to dig into the details, and know exactly how things work, and understand why such and such a decision was made.  

As for these quick-start-boilerplates, they often ends up being more confusing than helpful.

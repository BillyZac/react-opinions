# You're not just creating software, you're creating a team

What is the goal? Your goal might be to create a product as quickly as possible. If so, do not take this advice. That's a fine goal, but you'll need to follow a different guide to get there. 

My goal is to create a team. A group of people who can go further together than any of them can go alone. Each of which is improved my being on the team. When you leave the team, you will be better than when you joined. And when it's time to leave, you'll feel a little sad, because working together in this way is so good and so rare.

We could just find the best framework and the best tutorial on that framework, train on it, and then crank out apps like Charlie Chaplin. But that sounds like it'd be fun for about two months. Once you figure out how it all works, it becomes incredibly boring. Curious-minded people leave the team, and the whole thing becomes more and more about turning a crank.

Thus the focus on understanding the fundamentals. Working in this way will make you understand how the Redux pattern works, and you can take that anywhere. How Javascript itself works. Not just the how, but also the why.

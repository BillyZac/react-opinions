# Everything deserves to be a component

Nothing is too small to be a component. If it is a thing on the screen, it deserves to have it's own file and it's own name.

We should think of it like this: Anything may be complex. We just don't know. It may look small, or seem simple, and maybe it is, for now. But we don't know what kind of magic goes into that small, simple thing. And we don't care, as long as it does it's job. 

It may be simple now, but we should have a structure in place to allow for growth. The naive solution and the sophisticated solution should live within the same structure. By the same rules. The structure of the codebase is clear and readable, no matter the level of sophistication. As the codebase matures, it maintains its fundamental structure. It simply fills it in.
